## Abstract 

This repository contains project files, code, documentation, and supporting information for information related to ArcGIS-driven modifications to the AirNow process, in collaboration between Esri and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Every day the [Air Quality Index (AQI)](https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi) tells you how clean or polluted your outdoor air is, along with associated health effects that may be of concern. The AQI translates air quality data into numbers and colors that help people understand when to take action to protect their health.

The process is supported by an extensive system of webpages, map visualizations, reports, social media feeds, and applications that are built with the goal of informing the public and internal audiences on the state of air quality across the nation. This project aims to help the AirNow program continue to iterate and improve with the needs of its audience and users of the data.
